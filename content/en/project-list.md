The project list shows all projects you are a member of. The list is divided into three sections:

- **My projects** – projects you have created
- **Invited projects** – projects that other users have invited you to
- **Project templates** – project templates used to create new projects

Each project has buttons for project management:

- **Project settings** – Access basic project settings directly without opening the project
- **Leave** – Leave a project you have joined by invitation. This only applies to invited projects.
- **Clone project** – Create a copy of the project, for example to create multiple versions of the same project
- **Delete** – Deletes the project. Deleted projects are only marked as deleted and data is retained for 30 days in case of accidental deletion. If you want to restore a project, contact support. After 30 days, a deleted project can no longer be restored.
