## Mouse

Mouse navigation follows the familiar navigation from common map applications:

- **Left button** - Pan from place to place while maintaining the same height and camera angle
- **Middle button** - Zoom in / out either by pressing the button and moving the mouse or using the mouse wheel
- **Right button** - Rotate around the object under the mouse cursor horizontally / vertically

All navigation takes the object under the mouse as the center point of navigation. By pointing at e.g. a building corner, you can rotate around that corner.

## Touch Screens

Touch screen navigation also follows familiar navigation from common map applications:

- **One finger** - Pan the same way as with a mouse
- **Pinch with two fingers** - Zoom in or out the same way as with a mouse
- **Rotate with two fingers** - Rotate the same way as with a mouse
