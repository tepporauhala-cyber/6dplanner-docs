## Mouse

Mouse navigation follows common map application navigation:

- **Left button** - Pan from place to place while maintaining height and camera angle
- **Middle button** - Zoom in / out by pressing the button and moving the mouse or using the scroll wheel
- **Right button** - Rotate around the object under the cursor horizontally / vertically

All navigation uses the object under the cursor as the center point. For example, by pointing at a building corner you can rotate around that corner.

## Touch screens

Touch screen navigation also follows common map application navigation:

- **One finger** - Pan the same way as with mouse
- **Pinch with two fingers** - Zoom in or out the same way as with mouse
- **Rotate with two fingers** - Rotate the same way as with mouse
