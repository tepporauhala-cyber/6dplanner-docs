The Query tool is a powerful integrated database search that enables quick finding of BIM objects from large project data.

## Functionality

- **New** - Define a new query rule
- **Save** - Save an existing query rule
- **Execute** - Execute the actively selected query rule

### Rule Editor

- Use **AND / OR / XOR** rules to define multiple conditions
- Use **"Folder"** rule to limit queries to a specific folder
- Use **"Attribute"** rule to search based on attribute values
- Use **"Data type"** rule to limit queries to specific data types

### Result Style

- **Result** - Presentation styles for results
- **Others** - Presentation styles for other data
- **Color** - Object color
- **Transparency** - Object transparency
- **Visibility** - Force results visible / hidden

## Tips

Link query results to 4D Gantt schedule tasks for object-level scheduling. This way tasks always find objects based on query rules, even when models are updated.
