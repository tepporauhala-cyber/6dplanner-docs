Profile settings are used to edit the user profile:

- **Profile picture** – User's personal image. Currently not in use, reserved for future features.
- **Username** – Change the user's username, which is the user's display name in many tools.
- **Email** – Change the user's email address. This requires a working email, as the new email address is verified before it becomes active.
- **First and last names** – User's real name
- **Language** – Language used in the user interface. 6DPlanner is translated into multiple languages, so users can use the tool in their native language. The language setting also affects how numbers, dates, and other values are displayed.
- **Delete my account** – Delete the user account. Be careful when using this, as it cannot be reversed. Users are permanently removed from the system.
- **Change password** – Change the user's password.
