The Sketch Model tool is a powerful smart modeling tool. Sketch Model tools are used for modeling quick simple sketch models.

## Element

Add individual elements with location and radius. Select a 3D model from the Library to place 3D objects in the project.

Suitable for e.g. landscaping plans, urban furniture and construction site machinery modeling.

## Line

Add polyline elements with line points, width and height. When height = 0, the line follows all models and ground below the line.

Suitable for e.g. outlining roads, tracks, fences or construction site ditches.

## Area

Add polyline areas with corner points and height. When height = 0, the area follows the ground surface.

Suitable for e.g. outlining building masses, parking areas or park areas.

## Volume

Add volume models with corner points and height.

Suitable for e.g. modeling earthwork masses, excavations or fills.
