4D Gantt is a powerful scheduling tool that replaces separate scheduling tools like MS Project or Primavera. It is used for managing project schedules.

## Toolbar

- **Import** - Import schedule from MS Project, Primavera and IFC formats
- **Export** - Export schedule to MS Project, Primavera, PDF, PNG, Excel or iCal formats
- **Set as baseline** - Saves the current schedule as a baseline for comparison
- **Undo / Redo** - Undo or redo changes

## Tasks

- Add tasks with the Plus button
- Edit task name, start and end date, duration and progress
- Hierarchical structure: tasks can contain subtasks
- Link tasks to each other with dependencies (FS, FF, SS, SF)

## 4D Simulation

Link tasks to model objects and visualize the schedule as a 4D simulation. With the Timeline tool you can play the animation and see the project progress over time.
