Project settings define project-specific settings for different tools.

**Note:** Some settings are only available for project manager user roles.

## General Settings

### Project Image

The project image allows setting a thumbnail for the project in the project list. By default, it is automatically created from the project's first view.

### Start Image

The start image allows setting a custom quick-help image that is shown to users when they open the project.

### Project Name

The project name is shown in the project list and in the browser title as the web page name.

### Coordinate System

The active coordinate system used for example in model placement or displaying coordinates in the Measurement tool.
