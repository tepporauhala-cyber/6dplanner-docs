The Clipping Plane tool is used to cut models open and create cross-section views in 3D space.

## Horizontal

The horizontal clipping plane cuts models horizontally. This is useful for examining e.g. building floor plans.

## Vertical

The vertical clipping plane cuts models vertically along a straight line between two points. This is useful for e.g. examining building structures along a wall line.

## Along Road Centerline

The road centerline clipping cuts models similar to a vertical clip, but perpendicular to and following the road centerline. You can adjust the clipping plane position by station number.
